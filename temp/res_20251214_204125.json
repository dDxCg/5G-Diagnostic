      "reasoning": "The flow shows a relatively normal pattern with TCP being used (tcp: None, udp: 1.0), a reasonable number of packets (TotPkts: 2, SrcPkts: 2), and no packet loss (Loss: 0, SrcLoss: 0, DstLoss: 0). Many features have typical values such as Mean (2.58), Load (130.13), and Rate (0.387). However, the missing critical features prevent a definitive classification."
    },
    {
      "label": "DoS",
      "reasoning": "While packet loss is 0, the high load (130.13) and the presence of UDP traffic could be indicative of a DoS attempt, especially given the missing features that could confirm malicious behavior. However, the low packet count and lack of RST flags mitigate this somewhat."
    },
    {
      "label": "malicious traffic",
      "reasoning": "The combination of UDP traffic and missing critical features makes this flow potentially malicious. The missing features could include indicators of unusual TCP behavior, connection patterns, or application-layer data characteristics.  The high load could indicate excessive resource consumption, although more context is needed."
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "The analysis of the provided raw features yields ambiguous results. The flow utilizes UDP and TCP, indicating a standard network connection. There is no observed packet loss, which is a positive sign. However, the high 'Load' value (130.13) warrants investigation.  The packet and byte counts are very low (TotPkts: 2, SrcPkts: 2, TotBytes: 84), which may indicate an incomplete or unusual flow. The missing 'critical features' (mentioned in the context) significantly hinder a definitive classification. These missing features could contain information about TCP sequence number behavior ('Seq'), inter-arrival times ('INT'), TCP round-trip time ('TcpRtt'), TCP connection establishment ('CON'), TCP FIN/RST flags ('RST', 'FIN'), source/destination hop counts ('sHops', 'dHops'), and various packet size metrics ('dMeanPktSz', 'Offset') which would be key indicators of normal or anomalous behavior. Without these, any prediction is highly uncertain. The presence of UDP and the high load could, in conjunction with missing features, suggest a possible Denial-of-Service (DoS) attempt or the movement of malicious traffic."
