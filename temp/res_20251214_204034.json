  "candidate_labels": [],
  "reasoning": "The predicted label is SYNFlood with a very high confidence. The top features show a strong indication of a SYN flood attack. The `tcp` feature is 1.0, confirming this is a TCP flow. The `sHops` feature is 1.0, indicating the source is likely on the same local network segment, or a very nearby network. More importantly, the `RST` feature is 1.0 which suggests that the server is responding with RST packets, which is typical in a SYN flood attack when the server's connection queue is exhausted. The `Seq` value being 8375.0 doesn't intrinsically indicate an attack, but combined with the high `RST` and `tcp` values, strengthens the suspicion. The other values like `TcpRtt`, `dMeanPktSz`, `Offset`, `CON`, `FIN`, `sTtl`, `INT`, and `Mean`, are not strongly indicative of an attack on their own but, in the context of the other features, further support the SYNFlood prediction. A SYN flood attack attempts to exhaust a server's resources by sending a large number of SYN packets without completing the TCP handshake. The high number of SYN packets eventually fills up the connection queue, preventing legitimate connection requests."
