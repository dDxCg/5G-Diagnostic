The lack of 'DstPkts' and 'DstBytes' despite 'TotPkts' and 'TotBytes' being non-zero could indicate a flood of packets affecting the source."

  "reasoning": "The provided raw features show a TCP flow with a non-zero rate (0.387301) and a high load (130.13). The flow has 2 total packets (TotPkts = 2), 2 source packets (SrcPkts = 2), and 0 destination packets (DstPkts = 0). The total bytes are 84, all from the source. The destination bytes are 0. The 'Status' is 1.0, indicating the flow was established and completed successfully (or is still ongoing, but the lack of destination traffic is concerning). The Absence of 'DstPkts' and 'DstBytes' is a strong indicator that the destination is not actively participating or receiving traffic. The 'Load' and 'SrcLoad' values being high means the source is under heavy load, which could be due to legitimate activity or a malicious flood. The missing features like 'AckDat', 'RST', 'sHops', 'Seq', 'Offset', 'dTtl', 'SrcWin', 'DstWin', among others, prevent a more definitive classification, but the current features point towards either a normal but unusual traffic pattern or possibly some form of malicious activity where the traffic is overwhelming the destination without clear response."
