      "reasoning": "The flow has only two packets, which is a very small number. This low traffic volume, combined with the lack of established TCP parameters (like Seq, AckDat, SrcTCPBase, DstTCPBase which are None), could indicate a reconnaissance or scanning activity."

      "reasoning": "The 'REQ' value is 1.0 and 'RSP' is 0.0, but other TCP flags are 0.0. The lack of typical TCP flow features and the incomplete data could also be indicative of some type of malicious activity, although more information is needed."

  ],
  "reasoning": "The provided network features describe a TCP flow with a very low volume of data transfer (TotPkts=2, TotBytes=84). The lack of values for several key TCP features like Seq, AckDat, SrcTCPBase, and DstTCPBase suggests a very short or incomplete connection. 'Loss' is reported as 0, and the 'Status' is 1.0, which indicates a successful completion, though it could be a very quick connection. The presence of UDP traffic (udp: 1.0) is noteworthy. Considering the limited data, it's difficult to definitively label the flow as normal. The low packet count and missing TCP parameters raise suspicion for scanning or reconnaissance activities. However, without more context or a longer flow duration, it could also represent a legitimate but brief interaction. Given this ambiguity, I'm marking the prediction as 'unknown'."
