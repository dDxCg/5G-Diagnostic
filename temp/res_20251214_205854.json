      "reasoning": "While the 'HTTPFlood' candidate has a lower probability, the features don't strongly suggest a flood. The 'REQ' value is 2.0, which is not excessively high for a normal connection. There are no indications of abnormal packet sizes or inter-arrival times that are typically associated with HTTP floods."

  ],
  "reasoning": "The provided flow features generally indicate legitimate network activity. The TCP features like 'tcp' (1.0), 'CON' (1.0), 'FIN' (1.0) suggest a TCP connection established and in a normal state. A 'Seq' value of 123456.0 shows regular sequence number progression. 'RST' is 0.0 indicating no TCP reset packets. 'TcpRtt' is 0.2, a low round-trip time, suggesting a healthy connection. The 'sHops' value of 2.0 is a reasonable hop count. The average packet size ('dMeanPktSz': 42.0, 'Mean': 10.5) appear normal.  The features do not exhibit any of the characteristics commonly associated with an HTTP Flood attack, such as a very high 'REQ' count, unusually small packet sizes, or skewed inter-arrival times. The 'AckDat' value of 50.0 is within a reasonable range. The 'INT' value of 0.3 suggests packets are arriving with a relatively consistent inter-arrival time. Overall, the collected features align with a typical, well-behaved TCP connection, justifying the 'Benign' prediction and high confidence."
